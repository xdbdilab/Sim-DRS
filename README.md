# Sim-DRS: a similarity-based dynamic resource scheduling algorithm for microservice-based web systems
## Abstract

Microservice-based Web Systems (MWS), which provide a fundamental infrastructure for constructing large-scale cloud-based Web applications, are designed as a set of independent, small and modular microservices implementing individual tasks and communicating with messages. This microservice-based architecture offers great application scalability, but meanwhile incurs complex and reactive autoscaling actions that are performed dynamically and periodically based on current workloads. However, this problem has thus far remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we formulate a problem of Dynamic Resource Scheduling for Microservice-based Web Systems (DRS-MWS) and propose a similarity-based heuristic scheduling algorithm that aims to quickly find viable scheduling schemes by utilizing solutions to similar problems. The performance superiority of the proposed scheduling solution in comparison with three state-of-the-art algorithms is illustrated by experimental results generated through a well-known microservice benchmark on disparate computing nodes in public clouds.
